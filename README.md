## Running

Prerequisite: [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
Also make sure there is a `dayXX.txt` file next to each spec with your puzzle input.

```sh
bun test --watch
```

or one specific day:

```sh
bun test --watch day01
```

## Lessons

Here's what I learned (or noticed) each day.

1. Edge cases hurt.
2. Save "oversolved" solutions for later.
3. AoC puzzle solving can be soothing too.
4. Spread operators can be slow!
5. Distractions kill focus.
6. Sometimes things are just different.
7. Experience with **chess** being useful. Nice!
8. JavaScript sorting goes d9rp d9rp...
9. TODO
10. TODO
11. Sometimes only results matter.
12. TODO
